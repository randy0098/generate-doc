= Asciidoctor Maven Plugin: AsciiDoc to PDF CJK Example
:cn-example-file: README-zh_CN
:jp-example-file: README-jp

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to PDF using CJK extensions to properly show CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) characters.

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to PDF using Asciidoctor PDF by invoking the `process-resources` goal (configured as the default goal):

 $ mvn

Open the generated files _target/generated-docs/{cn-example-file}.pdf_ and _target/generated-docs/{jp-example-file}.pdf_ in your PDF viewer to see the generated PDFs.

The examples used are the Chinese and Japanese translations of the Asciidoctor README document (all found link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/[here]). Contributed respectively by link:https://github.com/diguage[diguage] and link:https://github.com/Mizuho32[Mizuho32].

== Used Asciidoctor extensions

This project uses two Ruby extensions by link:https://github.com/chloerei[Rei] (link:https://twitter.com/chloerei[@chloerei]):

link:https://github.com/chloerei/asciidoctor-pdf-cjk[Asciidoctor PDF CJK]::
Fixes line wraps formatting inserting zero-width spaces (ZWSP) before CJ characters.

link:https://github.com/chloerei/asciidoctor-pdf-cjk-kai_gen_gothic[KaiGen Gothic Asciidoctor Theme]::
Contains style improvements as well as a much wider set of Hanzi and Kanji characters not found in the default fonts.

[NOTE]
====
`KaiGen Gothic Asciidoctor Theme` extension downloads 183 MB in required TTF fonts on every build into the target directory.
It would be advisable to cache those files in a real project.
////
Use this in `asciidoctor-pdf-cjk-example/target/gems-provided/gems/asciidoctor-pdf-cjk-kai_gen_gothic-0.1.1/exe/asciidoctor-pdf-cjk-kai_gen_gothic-install` to cache files.

Dir.chdir(FontsDir) do
  Fonts.each_with_index do |name, index|
    puts "[#{index + 1}/#{Fonts.count}] Downloading #{name}"
    unless File.exist?(name)
      File.open(name, 'wb') do |file|
        file.write open("https://github.com/chloerei/asciidoctor-pdf-cjk-kai_gen_gothic/releases/download/v0.1.0-fonts/#{name}").read
      end
    end
  end
end
